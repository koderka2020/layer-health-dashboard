He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, which was well-controlled with ACE inhibitors. He had been receiving oral anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran and antiarrhythmic therapy for the past few years, but his arrhythmic episodes persisted and required multiple admissions to the emergency room. After a thorough assessment, we proposed atrial fibrillation ablation to the patient.\n\nPROCEDURE:\nWe performed bipolar mapping of the right atrium with the ThermoCool SmartTouch SF ablation catheter. The inferior and superior vena cava, and coronary sinus were delineated, and the His potential was tagged in yellow. The interatrial septum was carefully reconstructed, and the Fossa ovalis was precisely defined by setting the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25-0.75 mV and tagging all the fragmented and low voltage signals in light blue. The FO location was further confirmed by ICE and the CartoSound module. We also assessed and reconstructed the structures of the left atrium using ICE and the CartoSound module. A single transseptal puncture was performed using the VIZIGO sheath and transseptal needle. The ThermoCool SmartTouch SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO sheath into the left atrium to perform anatomical mapping and PVI, following the CLOSE protocol. Ablations were performed with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. The entire procedure lasted 100 minutes, and there were no complications.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:\nAt discharge, the patient had no more symptoms and did not report any arrhythmic recurrences.

However, during the postoperative period, the patient started to experience painful and difficult voiding. After about a week, the patient was referred to a district hospital with fever, agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a large volume of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis with a small amount of urine in the bladder. Catheterization with a 6-Fr feeding tube failed because it did not pass beyond the subcoronal urethra. The patient underwent an emergency midline laparotomy which revealed a small intraperitoneal bladder rupture at the dome of the bladder.

He was diagnosed with schistosomiasis 40 years ago and was also found to have hypertension 1 year ago. The patient had pain on movement of the spine with bilateral Grade IV motor strength in both lower extremities and was diagnosed with a spinal cord and nerve root compression caused by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal.\n\nDiagnostic Findings:\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed which showed an elliptical abnormal signal shadow in the left side of the vertebral body and left peritoneum indicative of a dumbbell growth. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the T12-L4 paravertebral region. At discovery, a slightly longer T1\/T2 signal was observed with a size of 8.6 \u00d7 8.4 \u00d7 12.4 cm on the left side of the L1 vertebral body. The boundary was clear, and an uneven separation was observed. The lesion protruded into the erector spinae muscles and behind the retroperitoneum. The spinal cord was compressed, and the boundary was clear. Bone destruction was observable on the left lateral transverse process of L2, and the left kidney was significantly compressed.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient underwent surgical resection of the total tumor followed by spinal internal fixation of L1 to L2 with pedicle screws. Total laminectomy was performed for L1 and L2. Histopathological examination showed the presence of a lobulated neoplasm in a prominent extracellular myxoid matrix. The neoplastic cells were composed of syncytial cords of \"physaliphorous cells\" that contained abundant pale septated and vacuolated clear to bubbly cytoplasm with mild nuclear pleomorphism. Overt mitosis was not identified. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesional cells were positive to CK (+++), S100 (++), CD65 (+), neuron-specific enolase (++), epithelial membrane antigen (+++), and vimentin (+++). The coexpression of epithelial and mesenchymal immunohistochemical markers supported the notochordal lineage of the lesional cells. Ki67 was 3%+ in the lesional cells. The above histomorphological features in conjunction with the immune-phenotype observed confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma.\n\nOutcome:\nNo heavy ion radiotherapy was performed because the tumor massively invaded into spinal canal and foramen, compressing the spinal cord and nerve root directly. After 5-month follow-up, recurrence was found in the original lesion through the post-operative CT. Due to the complexity and size of the recurrence, a second operation was not possible.

Laboratory findings showed elevations in creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), and creatine kinase (CK).\nThe etiology of patient\u2019s rhabdomyolysis was unclear, but infectious, autoimmune, and malignant causes were investigated and excluded. The patient was aggressively treated with intravenous fluid resuscitation, and his myoglobinuria resolved soon after. Further medication review revealed that the patient had been recently started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis. Rifaximin has been occasionally reported to cause rhabdomyolysis in patients with hepatic insufficiency. The patient improved dramatically after cessation of the drug.\nThe patient\u2019s strength continued to improve with therapy, and he was discharged on day 16 with a diagnosis of rifaximin-induced rhabdomyolysis.\n\nDiagnoses:\n1.

However, forty-eight hours after admission, he developed confusion and agitation, followed by a rapid decline in his level of consciousness that progressed to coma with bilateral extensor posturing. A CT scan revealed multiple and bilateral frontal subcortical hypodense areas without a midline shift. Consequently, a diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome (FES) was reached, and the patient received supportive therapy with methylprednisolone (10mg\/kg\/day) for 3 days.\n\nTwo days later, the sedation and analgesia were withheld to assess the patient's neurological status. Subsequently, bilateral and spontaneous extensor posturing was observed with mechanical ventilation asynchrony, tachypnea (46\/min), profuse and generalized sweating, arterial hypertension (215\/112mmHg), and tachycardia (137\/min). These manifestations led to the diagnosis of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH). Consequently, propranolol (120mg\/d) and morphine (3mg) every 4 hours were added to the therapeutic regimen.\n\nOn the 8th ICU day, remifentanil and propofol were withdrawn and replaced with dexmedetomidine while propranolol and morphine were maintained at the previous doses.

The patient had a history of suffering from chest pain, fever, and coma for a fortnight in the postpartum period. The patient was previously diagnosed with multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) and treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, tigecycline, and colistin. However, these antimicrobial therapies did not work effectively.\n\nDuring the admission to our hospital, a full-body computed tomography (CT) scan identified thickened pericardium, bilateral pleural effusion with multiple exudative focuses, hepatosplenomegaly, and pelvic effusion in this patient. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started with piperacillin-tazobactam for Klebsiella pneumoniae infection followed by the use of meropenem, tigecycline, and colistin. On 18th May 2017, the treatment was further adjusted to include polymyxin B, as the patient's infection had aggravated in bilateral lungs compared to that upon admission. Four days later, multiple red rashes appeared on the patient's skin. SH with dark round spots was seen on 23rd May 2017, without pain or pruritus. More dark brown spots spread on the skin of the trunk and limbs, especially on that of the lower abdomen, right hand, and right foot.\n\nThe patient suffered from diarrhea suddenly with intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increasing to 19 cm H2O on 21st May 2017. About 500 ml black stool was found in the patient\u2019s excrement. Her serum creatinine was elevated dramatically, and anuria occurred. The laboratory examinations revealed that the patient suffered from coagulation abnormality and hyperfibrinolysis, hence disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n\nThe patient was transferred back to the local hospital for further treatment on 25th May 2017.

A spiral CT-scan with one millimetre thick sections of the temporal bone was performed, which demonstrated symmetrical extensive lucencies in the pericochlear bony otic capsules, including the promontories. The patient was diagnosed with genetically confirmed osteogenesis imperfecta type I.\n\nAn additional 3T MRI was performed, which included axial FLAIR imaging, axial diffusion-weighted imaging, and gadolinium-enhanced 3D fast field echo imaging (3D FFE) through the entire brain. Furthermore, 3D balanced steady-state gradient echo through the skull base completed the exam. The MRI images showed symmetric areas of increased signal intensity in the pericochlear regions on the FLAIR and 3D balanced steady-state images. These areas showed moderate enhancement on the 3D FFE-images after contrast administration.\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation, the patient received the necessary treatment, and her condition improved significantly.

He experienced pain and deformity in the right elbow and wrist joints and was diagnosed with Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.\n\nThe patient received manual reduction under nerve block on the day of injury, but due to the difficulty of maintaining the reduction of the radial head, open reduction and percutaneous procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Kirschner wires were inserted for open reduction and fixation of the fractured distal radius and ulna. A long-arm cast was used for external fixation with the elbow in 90\u00b0 flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.\n\nAfter 2 weeks, callus formation at the fractured bone was observed, and therefore, the cast was removed, and range of motion exercises of the elbow and wrist joints were initiated. The Kirschner wires were removed at 6 weeks postsurgery, and pain, range of motion limitation, and lateral instability were not observed in the elbow or wrist joints at 3 months after surgery.\n\nDuring the 3-year follow-up, radiographs showed a gradual correction in the outward displacement of the radial head. Twenty-one years after surgery, the patient returned to our hospital for another disorder, and radiographs of the previous Monteggia injury were taken. The biocompatibility of the radiocapitellar joint was good, and no malunion was found in the distal radius and ulna.\n\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nThe patient reports no spontaneous pain, pain during exercise, tenderness, or range of motion asymmetry, and is currently working as a computer programmer and performs weight training as a hobby without limitations.
