The laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.8 mg\/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg\/L, AST 150 UI\/L, and ALT 79 UI\/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission, and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

The source control includes an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. The patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and required mechanical ventilation. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole was added to piperacillin\/tazobactam. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin. There was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved. Despite the adequate mean arterial pressure, there was a new worsening of the clinical status featured anemia without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring showed a hyperdynamic septic state. Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, hydrocortisone was added to argipressin and norepinephrine, leading to paramount hemodynamic improvement. Continuous hemofiltration was carried out to treat the inflammatory response by four cycles. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia monitoring and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion, and a new CT showed a persistence of known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as hemodynamic parameters at monitoring.

The patient underwent a series of procedures, including thoracic ultrasound, medical thoracoscopy, and surgical pleural biopsy, to obtain a definitive diagnosis.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient had a complex hospital course, with multiple diagnostic tests and procedures performed during the hospital stay. Initially, a repeated CT scan was conducted, which ruled out a pulmonary embolism but confirmed moderate right pleural effusion with parietal and visceral pleural thickening, in the absence of significant parenchymal abnormalities. Subsequent thoracentesis was performed, and the fluid was consistent with exudate. However, the microbiological tests, including an acid-alcohol-fast bacilli (AAFB) search, were negative. The patient subsequently underwent a medical thoracoscopy, which revealed a large lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis, reactive mesothelial cells, and vascular proliferation, suggestive for non-specific pleuritis (NSP). The patient was treated with steroids and showed clinical and radiological improvement.\n\nSix months later, the patient complained of chest discomfort and mild dyspnea, and a relapse of a small amount of right pleural effusion associated with diffuse pleural thickening was detected through a CT scan. The patient was referred to the Thoracic Surgery Unit of Sant\u2019 Andrea University Hospital (Rome) for a surgical pleural biopsy, which revealed a diffuse fibrosing pleuritis, with hyaline features, fibrinous exudate, and a dense lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation. Immunoperoxidase stains showed a marked increase of IgG4 positive plasma cells, with high IgG4 serum levels. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related pleuritis. Steroid therapy was promptly initiated, with complete resolution of pleural effusion, improved respiratory symptoms, and the progressive reduction of IgG4 serum levels.\n\nDiagnosis and Condition:\nThe final diagnosis was IgG4-related pleuritis. The patient's condition improved with steroid therapy, and the discharge was approved.\n\nDischarge Plan:\nThe patient is advised to continue taking the prescribed medication and to follow-up with their physician as per schedule.

At the time of admission, she presented with cardiovascular symptoms including shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest pain.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a midline sternotomy procedure under general anesthesia. The procedure involved the resection of the thymus due to its enormous size and standard cannulation through the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava. Cardioplegic arrest with full flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was induced for the patient. The surgical team examined the aortic valve and found some significant enlargement and dilatation of the leaflet; however, no intervention was performed as the valve was manually competent. The surgical team also identified significant enlargement of both atria, and as a result, resected right and left atrial appendages in combination with atrioplasty.\n\nThe surgical team opened the left atrium, examined the mitral valve, and found significant myxomatous changes of both anterior and posterior leaflets. The valve was deemed irreparable, and the decision was made intraoperatively to replace the mitral valve with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis. After this, the team performed commissural tricuspid annuloplasty on the tricuspid valve which rendered it competent. The patient was fully rewarmed and weaned off CPB with trace tricuspid regurgitation observed on intraoperative TEE.\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE: The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) and monitored for stability. During the first 15 hours in the CSICU, the chest tubes drained blood with a total of 1,450 mL (right lower pleura), 300 mL (mediastinum), and 1,330 mL (left lower pleura). The bleeding was controlled after the patient received five units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), seven units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (Cryo), two units of platelets, and two doses of intravenous protamine sulfate (50 mg per dose). The patient was subsequently shifted from the CSICU to the ward on postoperative day 3 (POD 3) and monitored for normal lab values.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient's chest drains were removed subsequently, and she was able to resume normal activity. Predischarge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no significant changes, and the patient was deemed satisfactory for discharge. The patient was discharged home on POD 6 and advised to follow the prescribed postoperative care plan. She was provided with instructions for taking care of any wounds and incisions that need monitoring. Additionally, the patient was advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any sudden worsening of symptoms that require medical attention.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS\/TREATMENT: Mitral and tricuspid valve replacement with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis and commissural tricuspid annuloplasty performed for CCL syndrome.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient was advised to follow up with the clinic for further evaluation and counseling with a medical geneticist.

The fentanyl dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 2400 \u03bcg\/day (MED 240 mg\/day) after 10 days in the hospital. Administration of a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid alleviated the pancreatitis and abdominal pain.\n\nThe patient subsequently developed nausea\/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation of continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion. Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 \u03bcg\/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared.\n\nThe patient was then switched to a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later, and therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 \u03bcg\/day.

She had undergone two reconstructive procedures in local medical centers at the ages of seven and 14. The patient presented with severe scar contractures and a large tumor of approximately 15 \u00d7 12 cm on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest. In addition, the patient had limited mouth opening (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed. The patient had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but had failed for unsuccessful airway topicalization and intubation (ATI). Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and management.\n\nDuring the preoperative physical examination, the patient's chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles were completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable. The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth. Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea. Face mask ventilation could not be performed due to the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible. According to guidelines on the management of difficult airway, an awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization was considered the preferred approach; however, the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before. Other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScope\u24c7 Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seemed impossible. Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation was scheduled.\n\nAfter obtaining a written informed consent with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway and intramuscular injection of Atropine 0.5 mg to reduce secretion 30 minutes before transferring to the operating room, the patient was monitored for respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS).

Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal. Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L\/min was delivered by a hose through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia. When lidocaine worked, about 5 minutes later, sevoflurane was inhaled again until the BIS reached 55\u201360.

The pathology report showed increased infiltration of the buccal mucosa with monoclonal plasma cells, and the diagnosis of soft tissue plasmacytoma was confirmed. The patient received localized radiotherapy with a total dose of 40 Gy, and the bone marrow biopsy revealed the absence of neoplastic infiltration.\n\nAfter five years, the patient presented with a painless swelling in his right testis. An ultrasound of the scrotum was performed that showed a hypoechoic mass in the right testicle with increased vascularization, and a normal-appearing left testis. The patient subsequently underwent a right radical orchiectomy and histopathology report showed testicular infiltration by a plasma cell neoplasm with identical immunophenotype to the primary site in the oral cavity. After one year, the patient presented again with painless swelling of his left testis that was attributed to disease relapse.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe patient refused to undergo left orchiectomy, thus he proceeded with systemic treatment based on lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. Following 4 cycles of treatment, the patient underwent high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation. A complete response was achieved with negative PET\/CT scan and negative marrow minimal residual disease assessment.

Upon admission, the patient presented with conjunctival hypertrophy and infiltrated growth into cornea about 2 mm from the nasal limbus, microvascular tissue hypertrophy of about 2.5 mm across the corneal limbus, and hyperemia grayish-white infiltrate of cornea about 5 mm in diameter.\n\nDiagnostic Approach:\n\nThe patient underwent direct microscopy of corneal scrapings stained with Gram and KOH preparation, which yielded negative results for organisms. The patient was then prescribed empiric fortified topical and systemic antibiotics, including ornidazole, tobramycin, vancomycin, natamycin, and fluconazole. However, after three days, there was still no noteworthy improvement, prompting the decision to perform an excision of pterygium and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty in the left eye.

Initial evaluation revealed subcutaneous emphysema in the cervical and thoracic regions and dullness to percussion in both lung bases. Investigation results showed sepsis of unclear etiology, although there was a suspicious of esophageal perforation predisposing mediastinitis and sepsis.

The patient underwent initial treatment including intravenous fluid, nothing per oral (NPO), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesia. Due to the clinical condition of the patient, the thoracic surgery and gastroenterology teams decided on a non-operative approach based on endoscopic therapy. The patient underwent endoscopy and was found to have a distal auto-expandable esophageal prosthesis placed. The thoracic surgeon decided to put a bilateral pleural tube oriented toward the perforation preventing future complications. Biopsies of the esophageal mucosa were obtained confirming the clinical suspicion of eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nFive days after admission, a new endoscopic procedure was performed, revealing migration of the esophageal stent into the stomach, a persistent perforation defect in the lower third of the esophagus with granulation tissue and two small cavities suggesting a fistulous tract. An endoluminal vacuum-assisted closure with sponge was placed in the area of perforation with the fistula to control both complications. Over the next few weeks, three dressing changes of endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure with sponge were performed before esophago-pleural fistula resolution was evident.

During hospitalization at the gastroenterology department, a diagnostic workup was performed due to the patient's clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction. The patient complained of frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia. The physical examination showed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen, which was quite painful on palpation and without signs of incarceration or strangulation at that time. The surgeon opted for semielective surgery, considering the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration.\n\nAn operative procedure was performed, and hernial content consisting of the greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found. After adhesiolysis, the hernial defect was revealed, measuring about 7 cm in diameter and about 15 cm in the vertical line with significant rectus diastase in the supraumbilical part of the abdomen. The Rives-Stoppa technique was used to create a wide retromuscular space, and a 30 \u00d7 25 cm polypropylene mesh was placed in the retromuscular space to ensure adequate mesh overlap over the edges of the hernia defect.\n\nDuring the operative procedure, the surgeon opted for rectus mobilization by the ACS method to avoid bridging, considering the anterior fascia's decreased abdominal wall elasticity. Four redon drains were placed postoperatively. The postoperative course was complicated by skin ischemia, requiring necrosectomy to remove the skin's necrotic foci.

However, during the postoperative period, the patient started to experience painful and difficult voiding. After about a week, the patient was referred to a district hospital with fever, agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a large volume of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis with a small amount of urine in the bladder. Catheterization with a 6-Fr feeding tube failed because it did not pass beyond the subcoronal urethra. The patient underwent an emergency midline laparotomy which revealed a small intraperitoneal bladder rupture at the dome of the bladder. The diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was made, likely caused by near-total urethral obstruction. The rupture site was repaired in two layers, and a suprapubic cystostomy catheter was fixed.\n\nFollow-up:\nTwo months later, at our center, antegrade voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed via the suprapubic catheter which showed terminal urethral obstruction. A decision was made to explore the area and repair the urethra. An end-to-end urethral anastomosis was performed, and the postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged home with a suprapubic and urethral catheter. The urethral catheter was removed seven days following surgery, and the suprapubic catheter was removed four weeks after surgery following normal urethral voiding and normal ultrasound.

In addition, an anterior open bite was noted without thumb sucking.\n\nTreatment was planned with three primary objectives: pain prevention and treatment, protection of dental tissue integrity in order to maintain occlusal function and limit dental biofilm retention, and restoration of smile aesthetics. The choice of treatment for the primary molars was stainless steel crowns (3 M\u2122 ESPE\u2122) due to lost occlusal morphology. This way, vertical dimension was slightly increased and maintained. The incisors and canines were isolated with a rubber dam and direct dental composite restorations were placed using Herculite composite resin with ER2 adhesives Optibond SL.

A mixed cystic and solid left adnexal mass measuring 8.6 \u00d7 6.7 \u00d7 8.3 cm was discovered during an ultrasound examination. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed early in the second trimester. Grossly, an intact 7.5 cm complex cystic-solid mass with nearly half involved by a friable, tan-yellow tumor with papillary excrescences, some of which were freely floating within the cyst cavity was noted. Histologic sections revealed a struma ovarii with over 50% characterized by the classic features of a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The periphery of the tumor impinged on the ovarian capsule and vascular structures, but no definitive evidence of invasion was found on the histologic sections reviewed. Ovarian mature cystic teratoma was also present in other areas of the tumor.\n\nThe patient\u2019s tumor expressed positive immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), but was negative for BRAF V600E. Serum Tg was found to be elevated after surgical removal of the ovarian mass, which is reasonably expected given the proximity to surgery and the known increase in Tg levels during pregnancy. Thyroid function tests and thyroid ultrasound were normal. Levothyroxine (L-T4) was initiated to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).\n\nAfter delivery, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy to permit evaluation for metastatic disease and monitoring for recurrence by Tg levels. Thyroid pathology was benign. Several months after delivery, cessation of lactation and L-T4 withdrawal resulted in an unexpected rise in Tg levels. A concurrent diagnostic I-131 scan was performed with planar and SPECT\/CT imaging. The scan revealed focal central neck activity consistent with thyroid remnant and the presence of iodine-avid skeletal metastatic disease involving the left ninth rib, bilateral proximal femurs and sacrum. High-quality SPECT\/CT images eliminated the need for separate dedicated CT and bone scan. The patient was treated with TSH suppression resulting in an undetectable Tg level.\n\nFollow-up evaluations demonstrated a stimulated Tg level and negative diagnostic I-131 scan without focal abnormal radioiodine uptake in the neck or skeleton. A 100 mCi I-131 therapeutic challenge was performed to eliminate any microscopic residual disease and more accurately ascertain the treatment response. The post-therapy I-131 scan demonstrated complete resolution of pulmonary metastatic disease. Faint residual foci of activity were demonstrated in the left ninth rib, sacrum, and left proximal femur, consistent with a partial therapeutic response in the skeleton.\n\nThe patient continues to do well, being conservatively managed with active clinical and biochemical monitoring during L-T4 suppression therapy."},{"id":475,"provider_name":"Arleta Bunyan","hospital_name":"Evergreen General Hospital","creation_date":"2018-11-12T05:47:34Z","patient_id":7,"text":"Hospital Course:\nThe patient, a 79-year-old woman, was admitted for evaluation of abnormal murmur. She presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination revealed a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest with basal crackles in both lungs. Chest radiography showed mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary congestion. The ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.\nTransthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with markedly dilated left atrium. The LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography also showed an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA. There was an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. Moreover, there was severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.\nCoronary angiography with a single RCA injection revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, establishing the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. The calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow was 1.4, confirming a significant left-to-right shunt. Coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium.

Physical examination revealed severe icteric sclera and skin without any abdominal tenderness. \n\nDiagnostic Results: \n\nLiver function tests showed severe hepatic injury and obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound of the liver showed a cystic mass with sharp margins in the left medial liver lobe and obstruction of the biliary tract. CT and MRI confirmed the presence of a cystic mass with homogeneous water-density lesions, indicating a hepatic cyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a lump in the common bile duct but no stones were found. A subsequent open procedure confirmed a large pedunculated lump from the liver, which resembled the gallbladder with a capsule wall and capsular space. Histopathologic examination confirmed the lump was a hepatic cyst wall without heterocysts or tumor cells. \n\nHospital Course: \n\nEndoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) were performed to drain bile in order to manage severe hepatic injury and jaundice, instead of laparotomy due to coagulation disorders. After these procedures, there was a gradual decrease in icteric sclera and skin, recovery of liver function, and normalization of coagulation disorders. Four weeks later, open operation was performed, and the pedunculated lump from the liver was removed entirely from the lump's root through endoscopic needle-knife electrotomy without active hemorrhage. \n\nTreatment: \n\nA T-tube was retained in the common bile duct to prevent bile leakage and observe the recovery of the root incision of the lump and postoperative bleeding. The patient was discharged with appropriate post-operative care instructions. \n\nFollow-up: \n\nEpigastric ultrasound and CT two months later showed a normal hepatic duct and unchanged hepatic cyst size. Choledochoscopic examination was performed through a T-tube fistula. The cyst had remained unchanged, and there was no evidence of bile duct tumor. Three years after the procedure, the patient was in good health, without signs of cholestasis or bile duct stones. The cyst had barely changed in size. \n\nSummary: \n\nThis hospital course summary is for a 41-year-old female who presented with persistent liver dysfunction and painless xanthochromia and skin itching for 3 months.

She had previously sought medical attention at a local hospital for facial redness and edema caused by eating a mango, and was treated with dexamethasone for five days. The patient gradually developed severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema over the course of one month. \n\nMedical History:\nThe patient had a history of a 5.5-cm mass located in the right posterior lobe of the liver detected by ultrasound in a routine physical examination 16 months ago at a local hospital. However, the patient did not experience any symptoms at that time.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nUpon hospitalization, the patient was found to have \u201cmoon face\u201d and severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema. The skin was diffused with acne, and both armpits had hyperpigmentation.\n\nDiagnostic Findings:\nLaboratory tests revealed that the patient had marked hypokalemia, which did not normalize with oral and intravenous potassium supplementation until spironolactone was added. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test confirmed diabetes mellitus. Endocrinological investigation identified severe hypercortisolism with loss of circadian rhythm, and plasma ACTH level was elevated to 1157 pg\/mL, confirming ACTH-dependent Cushing\u2019s syndrome. MRI and contrasted MRI revealed no pituitary adenoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed that the mass lesion was located in the right adrenal gland and not in the right hepatic posterior lobe. PET\/CT showed moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mass.\n\nTreatment:\nAdrenal tumorectomy was performed, and no hypertensive crisis occurred during surgery. A 6.5-cm black mass was found arising from the medial branch of the right adrenal gland. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tumor revealed that most of the cells were chromaffin-like cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor showed positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA) and CD56, with a Ki67 labeling index of approximately 16% for chromaffin-like cells. ACTH levels decreased from 715 to 14.3 pg\/ml one day after surgery, and serum cortisol levels decreased from more than 50 to 10.4 \u03bcg\/dl.

She was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation shortly after admission. The patient had a history of asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune syndrome) and end-stage renal disease with a post-renal transplantation. She was chronically on immunosuppressive medications for ongoing renal rejection. Additionally, she was receiving peritoneal dialysis for renal failure and was recently started on dapsone for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. During her 3-week hospital stay, she developed several complications, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and thrombocytopenia. She was prescribed with several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, mycophenolate, prednisolone, pantoprazole, cefepime, and dapsone. \n\nOn the third week of her admission, the patient developed diarrhea and metabolic acidosis. She was further noted to have cyanosis and low oxygen saturation levels (82%-87%) despite the escalation of inspired oxygen levels to 100%. The patient underwent blood gas analysis, which was consistent with metabolic acidosis and thus prompted a suspicion of methemoglobinemia. Co-oximetry was ordered, and the result showed a methemoglobin level of 21.5% (normal range is 0% to 2%). Hemolysis was ruled out upon conducting laboratory workup. As the patient had end-stage renal disease, methylene blue was contraindicated. As a result, daily ascorbic acid was administered orally via a gastrostomy tube, and dapsone was discontinued. Serial methemoglobin levels on co-oximetry showed an improvement trend. Within 48 hours, the methemoglobinemia resolved, and the level came down to 0.4 mg\/dL. The patient continued to receive ascorbic acid for four more days, after which it was discontinued. Following discontinuement of ascorbic acid, the methemoglobin level remained less than 0.3 mg\/dL. \n\nAfter a thorough review of the patient's medications and workup, it was determined that dapsone was the probable cause of methemoglobinemia. In light of this, the patient was prescribed with pentamidine nebulization for Pneumocystis prophylaxis.\n\nAt the time of discharge, the patient's cardiorespiratory function had significantly improved, with a stable methemoglobin level.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion, and close monitoring.\n\nAssessment: CT scan of the abdomen revealed a complex pancreatic mass representing a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst, which had increased in size when compared with the previous CT scans. EGD\/EUS showed submucosal bulging likely from extrinsic compression on the proximal gastric body and fundus with a small clean-based ulcer on the top of this bulge. EUS confirmed the presence of anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing suggestive of cyst\/pseudocyst with bleeding located in the tail of the pancreas. The patient continued to have melena and a decrease in hemoglobin to 6.3 g\/dL for which an additional two units of PRBCs were provided.\n\nIntervention: Interventional Radiology was requested to perform a mesenteric angiogram with hope that it may help identify and control the source of bleeding; however, angiogram did not demonstrate any active bleeding vessel. Ultimately, the bleeding stopped spontaneously. The patient had another EGD\/EUS which again noted two openings over the greater curvature of the stomach suggestive of fistulous communication of the lesion with the stomach lumen. A bullet-tipped catheter was inserted into the lumen, and aspiration showed blood consistent with hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst fistulizing into the stomach and causing severe upper gastrointestinal bleed.\n\nFollow-up: Follow-up CT abdomen one year later revealed calcification in the head and uncinate process of pancreas along with scarring in the uncinate process, consistent with chronic pancreatitis.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered, and the patient was started on a heparin infusion for 3 days until he improved enough to be weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. He was transferred to intermediate level of care on hospital day 2. Hematology recommended indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE. However, on the day of discharge, the patient had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. Physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch and right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. An emergent head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage, but an MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma. A CT of his pelvis showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma, and hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. After speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in his right flank. In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved bilaterally, but deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed, and our patient's recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and the patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits.

Standard anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of his left wrist revealed two osteolytic lesions involving the distal ulna and the lunate fossa of the distal radius without any joint involvement. Subsequent biopsy of his left ulna under regional anesthesia produced brown spongy material, histologically characterized by the presence of large numbers of multinucleated giant cells and spindle cells in a dense collagenous background. These findings were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and correlation with the clinical and radiological findings was recommended by the pathologist. As he had no other skeletal manifestations, a complete resection of the distal ulna followed, along with curettage and cementoplasty of the distal radial metaphysis, to support the articular surface.\n\nTwo weeks postoperatively, he was re-admitted to our orthopedic department with diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and localized abdominal pain. He also reported weight loss of approximately 5 kg. On palpation, he had tenderness in the thoracic wall, the second and fifth metacarpals of his right hand, the left tibia, the pelvic ring, and the left shoulder girdle and humerus. Plain radiographs revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in his ribs, right hand, left tibia, and scapula. A histopathological examination of both the resected ulna and the curettings of the radius revealed similar findings: numerous, multinucleated, osteoclast-type giant cells were noted amid a mononuclear, spindle cell, histiocytoid component. Based on the similar findings of both lesions and the rarity of multifocal GCT of bone, the histopathology report included in the differential diagnosis a Bone Tumor of hyperparathyroidism, either primary or in the setting of a paraneoplastic PTH-like protein production and suggested further patient evaluation.\n\nOur patient\u2019s laboratory examination showed high total serum calcium, low serum phosphorus, and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was suspected and confirmed by the elevated PTH levels. Serum potassium and sodium concentrations and thyroid hormone levels were in reference range, as well as the main cancer indicators. His human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was elevated. An isotope bone scan showed multiple sites of uptake over his ribs bilaterally, the lower pole of both scapulae, multiple foci in his pelvis, the metacarpal bones of his right hand, and his right tibia. At subsequent radiological work-up, both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography of his neck revealed a mass emanating from the right lobe of his thyroid gland. Parathyroid subtraction technetium-99m (99mTc) sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy showed extensive uptake in his right lower parathyroid gland. Multiple endocrine neoplasia was excluded because of the normal MRI imaging of his pituitary gland.\n\nAppropriate medical care was given to our patient including hyperhydration and high doses of diuretics and diphosphonates. After his health status improved and his serum calcium nearly normalized, a specialist surgeon was consulted for further surgical treatment. Surgery consisted of extensive resection: total thyroidectomy with removal of the parathyroid glands. A mass abutting the thyroid gland was documented at surgery. The mass was surrounded by a thick capsule, had a tan-brown, solid, and microcystic cut surface, and rubbery consistency. On histologic examination, the tumor comprised small cells with minimal to scanty cytoplasm and round nuclei, arranged in an organoid pattern, with frequent perivascular pseudorosettes. Thick fibrous septa emanating from the capsule were noted within the tumor. There was capsular invasion, with extension of neoplastic groups in the surrounding loose connective tissue adjacent to striated muscle, and foci of vascular invasion in the tumor capsule. The histologic findings were consistent with a parathyroid carcinoma. The neoplasm did not appear to invade the adjacent thyroid lobe and did not involve the margins of resection.\n\nThe patient experienced postoperatively persistent hypocalcemia requiring calcium and vitamin D replacement. His condition was characterized as \u201chungry bone syndrome.\u201d He is now recovering 12 months after surgery, with a serum PTH level of 7.1 pg\/mL and serum calcium level of 10.7 mg\/dl and he is under calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy.

He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an evaluation for his right shoulder mass. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. The MRI revealed a 6.9 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass involving the right deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, and the core biopsy showed a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.\n\nTreatment Approach:\nThe oncology department recommended neo-adjuvant radiation therapy followed by gross total resection with wide margins. Physiatry conducted a pre-operative evaluation to focus on functional prognostication. The patient's personal values combined with physiatric assessment determined the pre-surgical planning. A decision was made to take a narrower surgical margin around key muscle group (pectoralis major and deltoids) in order to help maintain the man's manual wheelchair mobility and his ability to independently transfer himself. In November 2014, he completed neo-adjuvant radiation therapy and underwent radical excision of his right shoulder mass with flap closure in December 2014.\n\nRehabilitation:\nThe patient began intensive inpatient rehabilitation after he was allowed to weight bear through his arm about 8 weeks later.

A right femoral triple lumen central venous line had been placed previously. After five days, he developed an acute occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the right common femoral vein, which was treated with LMWH (enoxaparin) at 1 mg\/kg for a planned three-month course, with the CVL being removed five days after initiating anticoagulation. The patient had no personal or family history of thrombophilia or bleeding diathesis. \n\nDuring his hospital course, he experienced multisystem organ failure secondary to DRESS syndrome as a result of anticonvulsive therapy. One week after starting LMWH heparin, he developed gross hematuria. In the setting of his anti-Xa levels continuing to rise, LMWH heparin was held, and anticoagulation was switched to unfractionated heparin. The patient required continuous venovenous hemofiltration and eventually, a steady regimen was found with consistently stable and therapeutic anti-Xa levels. \n\nUnfortunately, on the 15th day of this regimen, the patient developed signs of bowel obstruction with copious bilious vomiting.

An exploratory laparotomy was done, and 30 cm of the distal jejunum was found to be severely compromised and was resected. Pathologic analysis showed an extensive submucosal hematoma causing internal bulging of the mucosa and submucosa, causing attenuation and focal pressure necrosis of the muscularis propria.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient's submucosal hematoma was successfully resected, and he recovered in the pediatric ICU without further episodes of emesis or signs of bowel obstruction.

He reported prior history of incarceration and resided with his mother, for whom he was the primary caregiver. Initial vitals in the emergency department were significant for tachycardia. Physical examination at the time of admission revealed a thin, nontoxic appearing male.\n\nInitial laboratory workup was significant for absolute CD4 count of 26 (3%). Chest X-ray in the emergency department revealed a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level within the anterior medial right hemithorax and a loculated hydropneumothorax along the right lateral lung base. CT chest with contrast demonstrated two large, thick-walled cavitary lesions originating within the right lung parenchyma that appeared to communicate. His treatment was initiated with intravenous Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. The patient's stool PCR isolated a Salmonella species. Diagnostic thoracentesis yielded purulent fluid with WBC 505,000, RBC 0, pH 6.0, protein 3.7, LDH 41,239, and glucose 12. Pleural fluid culture was positive for Salmonella species.\n\nDue to presence of empyema, a right-sided chest tube was placed followed by instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and DNase twice daily for three consecutive days. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated two rim-enhancing hypodense lesions within the central mesentery of the abdomen. Intra-abdominal drains were placed under CT guidance into the mesenteric abscesses, from which nontyphi Salmonella eventually grew late in hospital course.\n\nOn hospital day #4 the patient's right-sided chest tube was noted to have persistent air leak. CT chest without contrast confirmed persistent right-sided hydropneumothorax with centrilobular ground glass opacities with lung entrapment. On hospital day #10, the patient underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication. Pleural peel pathology revealed pleural fibrosis, focal chronic inflammation, and mild anthracosis. The patient completed an additional two weeks of antibiotic therapy with intravenous Ceftriaxone from the date of decortication.\n\nOn follow-up at four-months, CT chest demonstrated improved but persistent loculated right pneumothorax with resolution of the right lung cavitary lesions. At seven months, the CT demonstrated complete resolution of the right-sided pneumothorax.\n\nRecommendations and Follow-up:\n\nThe patient is recommended to follow up with their primary care physician for ongoing management and monitoring of hypertension and substance abuse. Follow up imaging may be necessary to evaluate the persistence of loculated right pneumothorax. Further imaging may also be necessary to evaluate the rim-enhancing hypodense lesions within the central mesentery of the abdomen.

She presented with continuous low volume urine leakage that required 4-5 daily pads. The patient had normal voiding habits and no urge to void. On initial physical examination, the external genitalia showed no vaginal pooling of urine, normal urethral and vaginal openings, but intermittent urine leakage through the vaginal orifice. In her medical history, she had recurrent febrile UTIs since infancy, and was diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux grade III on the right kidney. Despite chronic chemoprophylaxis, she continued to experience urinary incontinence. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed normal kidneys with duplex-system suspicion on the left side and a normal-looking bladder. The VCUG was repeated, but no VUR was detected. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, which revealed a duplicated collecting system on the left side, and both ureters extended from the kidney to the point of extravesical insertion into the vagina. Both ectopic ureters were in very close vicinity. A diagnosis of ectopic ureter was made, and the patient was discharged with appropriate follow-up care.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nThe patient was advised to continue with therapy to address her ectopic ureter.

He was diagnosed with schistosomiasis 40 years ago and was also found to have hypertension 1 year ago. The patient had pain on movement of the spine with bilateral Grade IV motor strength in both lower extremities and was diagnosed with a spinal cord and nerve root compression caused by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal.\n\nDiagnostic Findings:\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed which showed an elliptical abnormal signal shadow in the left side of the vertebral body and left peritoneum indicative of a dumbbell growth. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the T12-L4 paravertebral region. At discovery, a slightly longer T1\/T2 signal was observed with a size of 8.6 \u00d7 8.4 \u00d7 12.4 cm on the left side of the L1 vertebral body. The boundary was clear, and an uneven separation was observed. The lesion protruded into the erector spinae muscles and behind the retroperitoneum. The spinal cord was compressed, and the boundary was clear. Bone destruction was observable on the left lateral transverse process of L2, and the left kidney was significantly compressed.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient underwent surgical resection of the total tumor followed by spinal internal fixation of L1 to L2 with pedicle screws. Total laminectomy was performed for L1 and L2. Histopathological examination showed the presence of a lobulated neoplasm in a prominent extracellular myxoid matrix. The neoplastic cells were composed of syncytial cords of \"physaliphorous cells\" that contained abundant pale septated and vacuolated clear to bubbly cytoplasm with mild nuclear pleomorphism. Overt mitosis was not identified. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesional cells were positive to CK (+++), S100 (++), CD65 (+), neuron-specific enolase (++), epithelial membrane antigen (+++), and vimentin (+++). The coexpression of epithelial and mesenchymal immunohistochemical markers supported the notochordal lineage of the lesional cells. Ki67 was 3%+ in the lesional cells. The above histomorphological features in conjunction with the immune-phenotype observed confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma.\n\nOutcome:\nNo heavy ion radiotherapy was performed because the tumor massively invaded into spinal canal and foramen, compressing the spinal cord and nerve root directly. After 5-month follow-up, recurrence was found in the original lesion through the post-operative CT. Due to the complexity and size of the recurrence, a second operation was not possible.

On examination, he had a heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122\/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths\/min, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Heart sounds were muffled, and heart rhythm was irregularly irregular. Distention of the jugular veins was observed, and Kussmaul's sign was present. Although pulsus paradoxus was not observed, other physical findings were extremely concerning for cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar crackles were present on lung auscultation. Laboratory data was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.42 and INR of 3.6 (on warfarin for a history of pulmonary embolism). His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and electrical alternans.

She reported no history of eye injury or trauma. On examination, the patient's VA was found to be 6\/24 in the right eye and 6\/5 in the left eye. Following slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with a right eye full-thickness macular hole, a left eye epiretinal membrane, and posterior vitreous detachment.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\nThe patient underwent right eye pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and cryotherapy with C3F8 12% gas tamponade. The procedure was successful, and the patient's VA had improved to 6\/18 with no complications. Unfortunately, seven weeks postoperatively, the patient developed right eye macula-on RD due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in the inferior retina. RD repair was performed, with a silicone oil (Densiron 68) tamponade and retinectomy to release the PVR. After four months, the patient's VA returned to 6\/12 with a flat retina and closed macular hole. However, four months later, the patient's VA declined to 6\/36 in the right eye. A fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed severe CMO in the right eye, for which the patient underwent right eye posterior sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone injection and was started on ketorolac trometamol eye drops (Acular) three times a day and oral acetazolamide 250 mg slow-release twice a day.\n\nTREATMENT INITIATED:\nThe patient received three posterior sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone injections and two intravitreal triamcinolone injections within 14 months, with no complications. Though the CMO initially responded to each triamcinolone injection, it later recurred. The patient then received four intravitreal dexamethasone 0.7-mg implants (Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc.) uneventfully. While the implants maintained a dry fovea for a longer period, the CMO recurred again. A trial of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Avastin) was not helpful.\n\nDISCHARGE INFORMATION:\nAfter two years without any successful treatments, the patient decided to receive ILUVIEN intravitreal implant. In the first week, the patient developed mild right eye anterior uveitis with an initial IOP of 27 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye, which was successfully managed with dexamethasone drops and latanoprost drops.

Two months prior to admission, the patient experienced dizziness, headaches, poor appetite, mouth bitterness, repeated vomiting, and intermittent abdominal pain. Joint pain and fatigue occurred subsequently, causing him to be unable to walk by himself. He was previously hospitalized twice for elevated serum liver enzymes and anemia; however, no etiology was identified. The patient was found to have \u201clead line\u201d pigmentation on gums, and radiographic findings showed increased linear radio-density at the distal femoral and proximal tibial and fibular metaphyses.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient had been using a red-colored folk medicine obtained from a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, which was found to have a high lead concentration. The patient received chelation therapy consisting of orally administered dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), intravenous calcium disodium edetate (CaNa2EDTA), and glutathione.

Laboratory tests indicated a venous blood lead level (BLL) of 91 \u03bcg\/dL. Radiography of the abdomen revealed shadow of stool and gas with points of increased density. The patient's symptoms were attributed to the use of a nasal spray liquid containing 223,000 mg\/kg (22.3%) lead prescribed by a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner for rhinitis. The patient received a cathartic to eliminate lead from the intestine prior to initiating chelation therapy with CaNa2EDTA. Despite the initial response, vaccination against DMSA was withheld due to a decrease in white blood cells.\n\nCourse of Treatment\nThe patient was treated with CaNa2EDTA chelation to achieve a BLL of 36 \u03bcg\/dL at the end of 5 days. Folium sennae was administered as a cathartic to eliminate lead from the intestine prior to initiating chelation. DMSA, which may have caused the reduction in white blood cells, was withheld subsequently. The patient was monitored for a total of 10 days, following which she was discharged.\n\nFollow-up Care\nThe patient was advised to follow up with her primary care provider for further evaluation and monitoring of her BLL. Additionally, she was advised to avoid TCM practices that may contain high levels of heavy metals.\n\nSummary\nThe 8-year-old female patient with a history of rhinitis developed severe digestive symptoms due to the use of a nasal spray containing high levels of lead prescribed by a TCM practitioner. She was treated with CaNa2EDTA chelation therapy to decrease the BLL. The discharge diagnosis was poisoning due to lead exposure, and the patient was advised to follow up with her primary care provider for further evaluation and monitoring."},{"id":996,"provider_name":"Roby Kinver","hospital_name":"Serenity Medical Center","creation_date":"2015-06-23T20:22:53Z","patient_id":43,"text":"Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient Information:\nThe 5-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital due to severe abdominal pain and vomiting. He had consulted a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner and was prescribed medication to be taken twice a day for seven days.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient's initial laboratory results showed elevated liver enzyme levels, and his liver was palpable 4 cm below the right costal margin. An abdominal x-ray did not show any abnormalities. Upon admission, his blood lead level (BLL) was 105 \u03bcg\/dL. The nasal spray that the patient had been using was found to contain 33.4% lead.\n\nChelation therapy was initially withheld due to concerns of potential hepatotoxicity with the two drugs prescribed. Instead, the patient was given treatment to improve liver function and continued this treatment throughout the hospital course. His liver function tests and BLL improved over time, reaching 34 \u03bcg\/dL after chelation with DMSA and CaNa2EDTA infusion.\n\nOutcome and Follow-Up:\nNo adverse events occurred during the course of the patient's treatment, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for monitoring of lead levels and liver function. \n\nImpression:\nThis patient presented with symptoms of lead poisoning after using a nasal spray containing lead.

She was initially diagnosed with a fracture at a local hospital and underwent splinting before being referred to our hospital. A blister was observed on the right forearm along the splint application area and considered to be due to the heat and stuffiness of the splint. Plain X-ray examination confirmed the fracture and surgery was planned.\n\nTreatment:\nA minimally invasive locking plate osteosynthesis was performed using the Henry approach through a small incision. The surgery reduced the distal bone fragment and stabilized it using a volar locking plate. The wrist was immobilized postoperatively in a bulky dressing without an arm splint until the tissue swelling had decreased. The patient was encouraged to perform active finger motion and wrist mobilization as soon as it was pain-free.\n\nOutcome:\nAfter six months, favorable union of the radius was obtained, and the range of motion in the wrist was recorded as follows: flexion, 70\u00b0; extension, 65\u00b0; pronation, 85\u00b0; and supination, 85\u00b0.
